# Sudoku-game-kivy
Game designed by using kivy module in python 

install kivy 
by using kivy.org website

and execute main.py to get the results 

this can be executable in mobile by using pydroid and install required modules 

random,numpy 

Then run it 
but it won't look nice because it is designed for pc which makes differenc in font size and all widgets size which makes it look ugly 
but runs well 

if want u can try to creat .exe file


by making changes in size of the window and widgets we can make apk file also and looks fine 

u can execute individual file to know how each class or moduloe works i already work some extra code at end to run the files individually also
